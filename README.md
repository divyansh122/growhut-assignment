# Frontend Developer Test 

## Overview

This repository contains a frontend application built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS for an "Orders Dashboard" as part of a frontend developer test. The app features a responsive sidebar, search and filter functionality for orders, and a clean UI matching a provided Figma design. It follows React best practices for clean, maintainable code.

## Features

Collapsible sidebar showing only icons when collapsed.

Orders table with search and filter options (Dealership, Service Type, Mode of Order, Status).

Filter chips for applied filters, removable via a close button.

Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

Non-functional placeholders for Notifications and AK Motors.

## Prerequisites

Node.js (v16.x or later)

npm (v8.x or later) or Yarn

A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
